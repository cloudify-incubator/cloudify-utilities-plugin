# Cloudify Utilities: Terminal

Terminal plugin provide support run command one by one and save result from executions each command to runtime properties.

Plugin have support:
* communication by ssh connection
* ssh connections with disabled agent on server side

Codebase have support for overwrite connection from properties by inputs for workflow action,
so we have support cases when we receive ip or other connection parameters only after creation of nodes.
This functionality has supposed for use when we created some server from template in infrastructure
and that reuse such node in other part of your blueprint. For implicit reuse ip you can use contained_in relationship.

# Node templates:

## Case with list of commands in blueprint
### General template for simple list of commands

```
  node_impl:
    type: cloudify.terminal.raw
    interfaces:
      cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
        create:
          inputs:
            terminal_auth:
              user: <user for instance>
              password: <optional, password for instance>
              ip: <optional, instance ip, plugin can get such ip from parent node>
              key_content: <optional, ssh key content for instance>
              port: <optional, by default 22>
              errors: <list strings that must raise error if contained in output>
              store_logs: <True |default:False store logs in separete file>
            calls:
              - action: <command for run>
                save_to: <field name for save to runtime properties, optional>
```

### Example for cisco ios devices

```
  ios_impl:
    type: cloudify.terminal.raw
    interfaces:
      cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
        create:
          inputs:
            terminal_auth:
              user: { get_input: terminal_user } # get user from input
              password: { get_input: terminal_password } # get password from input
              ip: { get_input: terminal_ip } # get ip from input
              key_content: { get_input: terminal_key_content } # get key from input
              port: { get_input: terminal_port } # get port from inputs
              errors:
                - "% " # Any errors have new line '%' with one space in line
            calls:
              - action: show ip http server all # dump all configs for http server
              - action: show ip domain # run show ip for domain command
                save_to: domain # will be saved to ctx.instance.runtime_properties['domain']
```

## Case with commands as separate file with placeholders
### General template for commands as separate file

```
  node_impl:
    type: cloudify.terminal.raw
    interfaces:
      cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
        start:
          inputs:
            terminal_auth:
              user: <user for instance>
              password: <optional, password for instance>
              ip: <optional, instance ip, plugin can get such ip from parent node>
              key_content: <optional, ssh key content for instance>
              port: <optional, by default 22>
              errors: <list strings that must raise error if contained in output>
              promt_check: <optional, list of prompt's>
            calls:
              - template: <template file name>
                params: <optional, list of parameters for your template>
                responses: <optional, list for possible question that required action from user with answers>
              - action: <command in same session>
```

### Example for fortinet devices

```
  forti_impl:
    type: cloudify.terminal.raw
    interfaces:
      cloudify.interfaces.lifecycle:
        start:
          inputs:
            terminal_auth: &terminal_auth
              user: { get_input: terminal_user } # get user from input
              password: { get_input: terminal_password } # get password from input
              ip: { get_input: terminal_ip } # get ip from input
              key_content: { get_input: terminal_key_content } # get key from input
              port: { get_input: terminal_port } # get port from inputs
              promt_check:
                - '#' # as promp use '#'
                - '$' # and also can be '$'
              errors:
                - "Command fail." # error possibly contain "Command fail."
            calls:
              - template: fortigate.txt # file name in same directory as blueprint
                params:
                  system: config system interface # replace {{system}} to 'config system interface'
                responses: # list of responses
                  - question: Do you want to continue? (y/n) # if plugin see 'Do you want to continue? (y/n)'
                    answer: y # plugin will response 'y'
              - action: aaa # same as previous
